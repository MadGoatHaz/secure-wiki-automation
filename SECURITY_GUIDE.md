# Security Guide

This document outlines the security considerations and best practices for using the Secure Wiki Automation Tool.

## Security Features

### Credential Security

The Secure Wiki Automation Tool implements several security measures to protect your credentials:

1. **Runtime Entry**: Credentials are never stored in files, environment variables, or logs. They are prompted for during execution and immediately cleared from memory after use.

2. **Hidden Input**: Password input is hidden to prevent shoulder surfing and screen recording.

3. **Memory Clearing**: Credentials are securely cleared from memory using multiple overwrites with random data.

4. **No Caching**: Credentials are never cached or stored in temporary files.

### Communication Security

1. **HTTPS Enforcement**: All API communication is conducted over HTTPS to ensure data encryption in transit.

2. **Secure Temporary Files**: Temporary files (cookies, logs) use process-specific names and are deleted after use.

3. **User Agent Strings**: Each wiki configuration can specify a custom user agent string for proper identification.

### Configuration Security

1. **File Permissions**: User configuration files should be stored with secure permissions (600) to prevent unauthorized access.

2. **Configuration Validation**: API URLs are validated to ensure they use HTTPS.

3. **No Sensitive Data in Logs**: Credentials and other sensitive information are never logged.

## Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Use Secure Networks**: Always use trusted networks when submitting wiki content.

2. **Verify API Endpoints**: Ensure you're connecting to legitimate wiki API endpoints.

3. **Monitor for Unusual Activity**: Watch for unexpected edits or authentication attempts.

4. **Use Strong Passwords**: Use strong, unique passwords for your wiki accounts.

5. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication**: If supported by your wiki, enable 2FA for additional security.

6. **Regular Updates**: Keep the tool updated to benefit from security improvements.

### For Developers

1. **Secure Coding Practices**: Follow secure coding practices when contributing to the project.

2. **Dependency Management**: Regularly update dependencies to address known vulnerabilities.

3. **Code Reviews**: Conduct thorough code reviews to identify potential security issues.

4. **Security Testing**: Include security considerations in testing procedures.

## Threat Model

### Potential Threats

1. **Credential Theft**: Unauthorized access to wiki account credentials.
2. **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**: Interception of communication between the tool and wiki APIs.
3. **Configuration File Access**: Unauthorized access to user configuration files.
4. **Malicious Content Submission**: Submission of spam or malicious content to wikis.

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **HTTPS Communication**: All API communication uses HTTPS to prevent eavesdropping.
2. **Secure Credential Handling**: Runtime entry and immediate memory clearing prevent credential theft.
3. **File Permissions**: User configuration files should use secure permissions.
4. **Content Validation**: Post-submission validation helps detect unauthorized changes.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it responsibly:

1. Do not create a public issue.
2. Contact the project maintainers directly.
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability.
4. Allow time for the issue to be addressed before disclosing publicly.

## Additional Security Considerations

### Network Security

1. Use trusted networks when submitting wiki content.
2. Verify API endpoints before submission.
3. Monitor for unusual network activity.
4. Consider using VPNs when accessing wikis from untrusted networks.

### Account Security

1. Use unique passwords for different wikis.
2. Enable two-factor authentication where available.
3. Regularly review account activity.
4. Use bot accounts for automated submissions when possible.

### System Security

1. Keep your operating system and Python installation updated.
2. Use antivirus software to detect malware.
3. Regularly review running processes.
4. Use firewalls to control network access.

## Compliance

This tool is designed to comply with common security standards and best practices for automated wiki editing. However, users are responsible for ensuring their use complies with the terms of service of the wikis they are editing.

## Privacy

The tool does not collect or transmit any personal information beyond what is necessary for wiki authentication and content submission. All data remains under the user's control.

## Updates

This security guide will be updated as new threats emerge and security practices evolve. Users are encouraged to review this guide periodically.
